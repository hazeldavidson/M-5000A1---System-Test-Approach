# M-5000A1---System-Test-Approach
Creating a full system testing code requires knowledge of the specific system under test, the testing framework, and the programming language you're using. Below is a simplified example in Python using the unittest module, a common testing framework for Python. This example assumes a hypothetical system with a Calculator class, and we're testing its basic functionality.
import unittest

class Calculator:
    def add(self, a, b):
        return a + b

    def subtract(self, a, b):
        return a - b

# Test case class for system testing
class TestCalculator(unittest.TestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        self.calculator = Calculator()

    def test_add(self):
        self.assertEqual(self.calculator.add(2, 3), 5)
        self.assertEqual(self.calculator.add(-1, 1), 0)
        self.assertEqual(self.calculator.add(0, 0), 0)

    def test_subtract(self):
        self.assertEqual(self.calculator.subtract(5, 2), 3)
        self.assertEqual(self.calculator.subtract(0, 0), 0)
        self.assertEqual(self.calculator.subtract(-1, -1), 0)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()


In this code, The Calculator class has two basic methods: add and subtract.
The TestCalculator class inherits from unittest.TestCase and contains test methods (test_add and test_subtract) to verify the functionality of the ‘Calculator’ class.
The setUp method is used to set up any necessary preconditions for the tests.
The assertEqual statements check whether the actual results match the expected results.
To run this code, save it in a file (e.g., system_test.py) and execute it. The testing framework will run the specified tests and report any failures or errors.
Remember that this is a basic example. In a real-world scenario, you would have more complex systems, additional test cases, and possibly use more advanced testing tools and frameworks depending on the language and technology stack of your system.
